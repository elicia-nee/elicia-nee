Hello, this is Elicia. <br>
<br>
I might not have the most motivation when it comes to programming and such so apologies if I'm not very active on here. <br>
I have experience in languages such as Python, Java, C++, C# and Rust, and am currently trying to learn game development. <br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read all this <3
